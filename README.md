#Landing page for arts store

##About the project
It's a landing page that I developed as a practice project based on CodeCademy prompt [link here](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-2/dasmotos-arts_redline.jpg)
Because it was very basic and I didn't like the way it looked, I decided to code a fully-fledged landing page based on that.
It's a work in progress.
Coded in HTML and CSS.

##Features
* navigation bar
* flexbox display of item types in the store section
* overlay button
* use of semantic elements of HTML5
* accessibility features

##Link

##To-do
* add FAQ section
* add contact section
* make sure it's fully responsive and looks good on all devices.
